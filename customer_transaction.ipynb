    "## Problem Framing\n",
    "### Business Problem\n",
    "Depending on their needs, consumers are more or less likely to take out a loan, to be receptive to a promotion. To increase their customer base and build customer loyalty, companies run marketing campaigns, creating a new need and incentivizing customers to buy.\n",
    "Santander wants to identify customers who are likely to make a specific future financial transaction by doing information mining with machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Objectives\n",
    "1.\tPredict customer transactions in order to increase the effectiveness of marketing campaigns and increase conversion rate by targeting customers who are more inclined to transact.\n",
    "2.\tThe objective of this model is therefore to reduce marketing costs by prioritizing the resources invested in attracting and personalizing offers to the most receptive customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage\n",
    "Predictions will be used by the marketing team to:\n",
    "-\tgenerate a ranked list of customers from highest → lowest probability\n",
    "-\tdeploy marketing campaigns (emails, offers, upselling)\n",
    "-\tevaluate campaign ROI\n",
    "\n",
    "### Machine learning approach\n",
    "Customer data for a given transaction is provided in an anonymized and labeled manner in the dataset train.csv present on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/santander-customer-transaction-prediction-dataset/data). Each instance is described by 200 real features and the desired prediction is provided as an integer (either 0 if there is no transaction, or 1 if there is a transaction). It is therefore a supervised learning task and more specifically a binary classification problem. \n",
    "In addition, the dataset is subject to a strong class imbalance. This reflects real-world business behavior. In general, the conversion rate of customers is naturally rare (often below 10%). As a result, class 1, describing the customers carrying out the transaction, is in the minority while class 0 is mostly represented. Most customers do not perform the transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Existing solutions\n",
    "Before ML:\n",
    "- Business teams guess based on demographics\n",
    "- Rule-based segmentation\n",
    "- Past behaviors used manually\n",
    "\n",
    "Broad marketing blasts → expensive and often ineffective (Sending promotional messages to everyone or to a very large group, without using ML or targeting )\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparable problems from industry:\n",
    "- Credit scoring (Scoring means using a trained ML model to assign a score (often a probability) to each customer.)\n",
    "- Customer churn prediction\n",
    "- Purchase/upsell prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Existing experience you can reuse:\n",
    "- Binary classification frameworks\n",
    "- Imbalanced classification techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected results \n",
    "#### General Assumptions\n",
    "**Data-Related assumptions:**\n",
    "- Features contain sufficient signal about customer behavior (var_0 ... var_199)\n",
    "- No data leakage exists between train/test splits\n",
    "- Feature distributions remain stable over time\n",
    "- Anonymized features are representative and sufficient for prediction \n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Preparation assumptions:**\n",
    "- Dataset contains no missing values \n",
    "- Outliers are removed entirely\n",
    "- All features are standardized\n",
    "- Class imbalance reflects real-world conversion rates (minority class is rare) \n",
    "\n",
    "**Modeling Assumptions:**\n",
    "- Imbalance handling works accross models\n",
    "- Historical patterns predict future customer behavior\n",
    "- Customers' future transactions depend on their feature profiles \n",
    "\n",
    "**Usage Assumptions:**\n",
    "- Predictions will be used ethically and legally\n",
    "- Marketing team will act on model outputs responsibly\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Models\n",
    "To conduct our study, we relied on the article provided (https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1757-899X/1088/1/012032) \n",
    "\n",
    "**System Type:** Offline prediction system (batch scoring), not real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach:** We test multiple models and compare them across three configurations to evaluate imbalance-handling strategies:\n",
    "1. Downsampled training data (balanced class distribution)\n",
    "2. Class-weighted models (on imbalanced data)\n",
    "3. Hyperparameter-tuned + PCA models (optimized for F1-score)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "| Model | Expected results | Key Caracteristics | Assumptions\n",
    "|:-----------------------------|:-----------------------------|:---------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------|\n",
    "| Binary Logistic Regression | Perform well with large dataset; moderate F1 if signal is linear; Fast | Interpretable, Binary/Probability outputs | Binary target; Target is a dependent variable; Independent observations (input samples) otherwise the standard errors are biased; No highly correlated independent variables; Independent variables are linearly related to the log odds of the dependent variable; large sample size and representativeness of all categories |\n",
    "| Linear SVC | Faster than SVC;  Good linear separator for high‑dimensional data; fast training | Sensitive to noisy observations (require regularization); Not scale invariant | Appropriate for linearly separable data; Representativeness of all categories |\n",
    "| SVC (RBF) | Slow Training; Accuracy of 90.43% and recall of 5.32% for class 1 (according to the paper) |  Quadratic programming problem (quadratic complexity depending on the number of features and samples); Sensitive to noisy observations (require regularization); Not scale invariant; Excels in high-dimensional spaces; Memory efficient | Can handle nonlinearly separable data; Representativeness of all categories |\n",
    "| K-Nearest Neighbors | may give high accuracy (95.71%) but poor minority recall (0%) in high dim (according to the paper); Modest performance (compare every point) | Sensitive to outliers and sparse data; Loss of accuracy for too many features | K should be an odd number; Representativeness of all categories; Only when local similarity is meaningful |\n",
    "| Gradient Boosting Classifier | Strong predictive power when tuned; risk of overfitting if not regularized | Less sentive to noise (it smooths updates using gradient); Suitable for complex problems; Important choice of learning rate |  |\n",
    "| LightGBM | Fast training; low memory; High performance | Gradient boosting with histogram-based splits; Preferred when training speed and memory footprint matter | |\n",
    "| CatBoost Classifier | Handles categorical structure; Stable without heavy preprocessing | Gradient boosting with categorical support  | |\n",
    "| Gaussian Naive Bayes | Accuracy of 14.69% (according to the paper); recall of 93.36% for class 1 | Independent features given the class; Continuous features are normally distributed; discrete features have multinomial distribution | |\n",
    "| Multi-Layer Perceptron | Can model complex patterns; Sensitive to scaling | Feedforward neural network | Requires normalized input; Sufficient dataset size |\n",
    "| XGBoost | High performance for tabular data | Optimized gradient boosting; Good for large datasets with nonlinear interactions | |\n",
    "| Random Forest Classifier | Good general performance | Robust; Tree ensemble; Handles noisy features; Parallelizable | Stable feature importance |\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Performance\n",
    "To evaluate the quality of predictions made by our models of machine learning, we will use performance metrics. The precision measures the portion of correctly classified transactions over all the prediction of transactions. The recall is the fraction of all transactions that were classified correctly.\n",
    "For imbalanced dataset, accuracy is not meaningful. Indeed, the models can always predict the majority class and consequently have a high accuracy. This is why the f1-score, calculated by combining the recall and the precision is preferred in this context. F1 score is a trade-off between the correctness of predictions and the model’s ability to distinguish each class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, to visualize the performance, the precision-recall curve (PRC) and the area under the curve (AUPRC) are plotted, as the ROC and AUC are not really adapted to unbalanced data, especially when the class of interest is in the minority. The AUPRC summarizes the performance of the model across the range of transaction class probability thresholds. The higher the AUPRC, the better the model for the positive class.\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of our problem, we want to reduce the investment of marketing campaigns by mainly targeting the customers who are most likely to complete a transaction. Thus, we will tend to favor a high precision, as false positives are expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tuning metric:** F1-score (balances precision and recall for imbalanced data)\n",
    "- **Evaluation metric:** PR-AUC (preferred over ROC-AUC for imbalanced classification where minority class matters)\n",
    "- **Business metric:** Precision (false positives are costly in marketing campaigns)\n",

    "- The target distribution shows a strong class imbalance: only ~10.05% of samples belong to the positive class (transaction = 1).\n",

    "- The ID_code column carries no predictive information and can be removed.\n",

    "To address the imbalance issue and ensures that our models learn patterns relevant to the minority class, we adopt two complementary strategies:\n",
